# astrotools

Repository containing a few regularly-used tools. 

Free to use but not guaranteed. 

## Install

Don't forget to add `$ASTROCODE` to your `$PATH` so you can use it to call python codes from scripts.

Next, you can add another path to the scripts so you can run them from anywhere. It's up to you.

Example : 

```
# Path to ASTROTOOLS
export ASTROCODE=[PATH/TO]/astrotools/src
export ASTROSCRIPTS=[PATH/TO]/scripts

# Add path to python scripts
export PATH=$PATH:$ASTROSCRIPTS
```

Obviously, you change `[PATH/TO]` to the correct path for you.
